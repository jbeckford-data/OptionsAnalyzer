# OptionsAnalyzer

Always improving.

Short program that will allow up to 4 options legs and show profit/loss graph for all entered.  Utilizes Black-Scholes modeling from mibian.

Number of legs is scalable if you wish to download.  Limited by screen size for myself.

Currently in the works...looking for suggestions... Looking for a better way to calculate each individual line.  Recalculates the entire system each time pressed.  Would like to be able to check if/what data has changed and only recalculate based on that.  i.e. change days forward, only 1 line needs to be recalculated, others are the same.
